## Introduction

[Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) is a React-based frontend for content
management systems, currently supporting three backend implementations: Plone,
Guillotina and a NodeJS reference implementation.

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a CMS built on Python with more than 17 years of
experience.

Plone has very interesting features that are still appealing to
developers and users alike as customizable content types, hierarchical URL
object traversing and a complex content workflow powered by a granular
permissions model that allows you to build from simple websites to complex huge
intranets.

Volto exposes all that features and communicates with Plone via its
mature [REST API](https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi). Volto has the
ability of being highly themable and customizable.

Volto also supports other APIs like [Guillotina](https://guillotina.io/), a
Python resource management system, which is inspired on Plone using the same
basic concepts like traversal, content types and permissions model.

Last but not least, it also supports a [Volto Nodejs-based backend reference](https://github.com/plone/volto-reference-backend) API implementation that
demos how other systems could also use Volto to display and create content
through it.

## Quick Start

First get all the requirements installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js LTS (10.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python 2.7.x](https://python.org/) or
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if using the Plone/Guillotina docker images)

### Create Volto App

Create a new Volto project by using the `create-volto-app` utility.

It will bootstrap a Volto project in a folder of your choice with all the required
boilerplate to start customizing your Volto site.

    $ npm install -g yarn
    $ npm install -g @plone/create-volto-app
    $ create-volto-app myvoltoproject
    $ cd myvoltoproject

Although we install and use `yarn`, the `create-volto-app` tool still needs to be
installed using `npm -g` because `yarn` has a different implementation of
global installs.

### Bootstrap the Plone API backend

We recommend Plone as backend of choice for Volto.

You can bootstrap a ready Docker Plone container with all the dependencies and ready for Volto use:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 kitconcept/plone.restapi:latest
```

### Start Volto

Once inside your Volto project folder:

```shell
$ yarn start
```

### Browsing

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Demo

You can try a Volto online demo in [https://volto.kitconcept.com](https://volto.kitconcept.com)

## Documentation

You can find the (beta) documentation in [http://docs.voltocms.com](http://docs.voltocms.com)

## Training

A detailed training on how to create your own website using Volto is available
as part of the Plone training docs at [https://training.plone.org/5/volto/index.html](https://training.plone.org/5/volto/index.html).

## Browser support

Volto works well with any modern (and updated) browser, including their mobile
flavors: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.

We do not guarantee that browsers who were deprecated by their vendors (e.g. Internet Explorer 11) will be supported by Volto in the future.


## Volto Development

For Volto development you need all the requirements already mentioned on the
[Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

### Checkout the Volto repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/plone/volto.git
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
$ yarn
```

### Install a backend

#### Plone (recommended)

Either using a Docker image

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 kitconcept/plone.restapi:latest
```

or running Plone on your machine (advanced), additional dependencies might be
required only for Plone experienced integrators/developers. Check the [Plone
Installation Documentation](https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation.html).

```shell
$ cd api
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```
#### Guillotina (experimental)

It still doesn't support the full API/features that Plone provides.

```shell
$ docker-compose -f g-api/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Run frontend

```shell
$ yarn start
```

### Browsing

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Testing

```shell
$ yarn test
```

### Releasing

For ease the release process, a package that helps with the process is
installed: `release-it`.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it

For using it and start a release you need to fulfill the requirements:

- Have permissions to push on master branch
- Have permissions on the @plone org on npmjs.com
- Have a environment variable (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) with a GitHub personal token to
  write the Release page on GitHub (https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it#github-releases)

Then the command for release:

```shell
$ yarn release
```

a dry-release command for testing the output is also available:

```shell
$ yarn dry-release
```

### Acceptance testing

```shell
$ make test-acceptance
```

Alternatively individual acceptances test case files can be run with a pure Robot Framework virtual environment, assuming that backend and frontend is running

```shell
$ docker-compose -f api/docker-compose.yml up
$ yarn && yarn build && RAZZLE_API_PATH=http://localhost:55001/plone yarn start:prod

$ virtualenv robotenv --no-site-packages
$ robotenv/bin/pip install robotframework robotframework-seleniumlibrary robotframework-webpack
$ robotenv/bin/pybot tests/test_login.robot
```
Another alternative for developing Robot Framework acceptance tests is to use Jupyter notebook

```shell
$ make -C api/jupyter
```

### Static Code Analysis

#### Prettier

Please refer to the [Prettier CLI documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html) for all usages.

##### CLI

Run Prettier through the CLI with this script.
Run it without any arguments to see the [options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html).

To format a file in-place, use `--write`.
You may want to consider committing your code before doing that, just in case.
`prettier [opts] [filename ...]`

In practice, this may look something like:<br />
`prettier --single-quote --trailing-comma es5 --write "{app,__{tests,mocks}__}/**/*.js"`

##### Using Plugins

Plugins are automatically loaded if you have them installed in your package.json. Prettier plugin package names must start with `@prettier/plugin- or prettier-plugin-` to be registered.

If the plugin is unable to be found automatically, you can load them with:

1.  The CLI, via the --plugin flag:

`prettier --write main.foo --plugin=./foo-plugin`

1.  Or the API, via the plugins field:

```
  prettier.format("code", {
    parser: "foo",
    plugins: ["./foo-plugin"]
  });
```

##### Pre commit hook

You can use Prettier with a pre-commit tool.

This can re-format your files that are marked as "staged" via `git add` before you commit.

1.  <b>Lint staged</b> Use Case: Useful for when you need to use other tools on top of Prettier (e.g. ESLint)

Install it along with husky: `yarn add lint-staged husky --dev`

and add this config to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "precommit": "lint-staged"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,json,css,md}": ["prettier --write", "git add"]
  }
}
```

1.  <b>Pretty-quick</b> Use Case: Great for when you want an entire file formatting on your changed/staged files.

`yarn add pretty-quick husky --dev`

and add this config to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "precommit": "pretty-quick --staged"
  }
}
```

More Precommit hooks can be found [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)

### Running Guillotina Tests

First, start up Guillotina:

```shell
docker-compose -f g-api/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Then, run the tests:

```shell
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/tests_guillotina env/bin/pybot -v BROWSER:headlesschrome tests_guillotina;
```
